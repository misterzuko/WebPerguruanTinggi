# 🏫 University Website – Frontend Project

This project is an experiment in building a modern university website using contemporary frontend technologies. The main focus is exploring workflows with **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **AOS**, as well as experimenting with modern UI/UX suitable for academic institutions.

---

## 📌 Background

I created this project as a hands-on practice to learn and integrate several frontend tools, including:

* **Vite JS (Vanilla)** as a fast and lightweight bundler.
* **Tailwind CSS** as a utility-based CSS framework.
* **AOS (Animate On Scroll)** to add smooth and modern scroll animations.

The goal is to understand how these tools work together while building a clean, responsive, and modern university website interface.
